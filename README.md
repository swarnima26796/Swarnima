# Swarnima Pandey <br/>
### Welcome to my profile :smiley: <br/>
I am on the path to become a **DATA ALCHEMIST** who brings out magic out of the data!! :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye: I love to explore the data and make insights out of it plus storytelling. Though I am a budding data scientist, Yet I am a pro at data cleaning, EDA, and data visualization. Since  **data is an oil, my machine learning models and sound analytics act as a combustion engine for it.** :wink: <br/>
#### Disclaimer: I believe in learning and implementing. My [portfolio](https://github.com/swarnima26796/Data-Science-Portfolio) repository includes both my original works as well as my hands-on works that I used in my learning process. <br>
